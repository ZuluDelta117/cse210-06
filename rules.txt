Zilch is a dice roller game based on risk-reward principles below are how you are able to play.

Player turns

-A player starts by rolling 6 6-sided dice.

-Once the player "locks in" one die, the player can re-roll the remaining dice.

-If a player is able to lock in all their dice, they may re-roll all their dice.

Reading the Point Sheet

-With the multiple dice combinations, you must collect a combination on one roll/re-roll. For example,
a player must roll 3 ones in one roll in order to get 1000 points. The player cannot collect 3 ones over
several rolls to get 1000 points (the player only would earn 300 points because the ones are 100 points each).

-Straight is at least 4 numbers in consecutive order. For example, a player can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4 and the player has earned a 
straight.
